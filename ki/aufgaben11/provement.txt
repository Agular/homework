The two lines p and q are on the same line.
P is to the right of q and the destination point of p is left of q destination point.

The closest situation where this situation can happen on the board is 
when p and q are right next to each other and when they are on each others destination points.
For one of them (p or q) to reach their destination, the other has to move away so that the other could immediately
move there. And that is of course a minimum of 2 moves. Considering the board situations, it could be often
more than 2 moves.
